# Molecular Dynamics

This is the final project for CS420.
Our basic idea is to implement OpenMP, MPI , GPU, intel compiler optimization for the sequential code.
For each methods, we would have a report of optimization details.
If possible, we would combine some of parallel methods together to see whether it works.

## OpenMP

## MPI

## sequential
main_sequential is a first draft, non-parallel MD code by Aidan
main_seq_continue is a draft based on first one by using continuous array to store force and coordinates of particles. The corresponding header file is particles.h .

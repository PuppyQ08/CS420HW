# Sequential
main_sequential is a first draft, non-parallel MD code by Aidan

main_seq_continue is a draft based on first one by using continuous array to store force and coordinates of particles. The corresponding header file is particles.h .
generate_coordinates.cpp is the code to generate initial coordinates. In that case we don't need to generate randomly coordinates every time and we can use same coordinates for various tests.
